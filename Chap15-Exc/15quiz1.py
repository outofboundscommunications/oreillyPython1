Question1 = 'What is the difference between a syntax error and an exception?'
Answer1='A syntax error occurs when you make a mistake while writing the code itself, such as forgetting to close a quote.\
Or you make a typo. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.\
Examples of exceptions could be type errors, arithmetic, index or argument errors.'

Question2a = 'How can you deal with exceptions in your code?'
Answer2a = 'Some exceptions are handled by Python itself but you can write logic to handle exceptions based on the try\
and except logic.  While X:\
                       try: \
                       except:'

Question2b ='How can you re-raise an exception?'
Answer2b = 'You can raise a specific exception of your choice by following the raise keyword with an exception. \
You can create that exception by calling any of the system exceptions with a string argument.'
